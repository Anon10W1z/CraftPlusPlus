<p>Welcome to Craft++'s website! This website contains the latest downloads, information, news and more for Craft++. Feel free to take a look around! The download buttons above will give you the latest source code in zip or tar.gz format.</p>

<a id="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h3>

<p>Craft++ is a mod designed to enhance vanilla Minecraft without going overboard. It is designed to be minimally invasive and configurable to create a user experience like none other.</p>

<h3>
<a id="features" class="anchor" href="#features" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h3>

<p>Craft++ adds a multitude of features to enhance your world. Warning for a wall of text:</p>

<ul>
<li>Several new enchantments!

<ul>
<li>Nimble and Hops: These enchantments go on your boots, and can go all the way up to level 3. Each level adds a bit to your movement speed and jump height, respectively.</li>
<li>Blazing: Automatically smelts everything the block drops. If you have fortune on your pickaxe, it will increase the stack size of the drops accordingly - but not for drops that are blocks themselves. It cannot be applied with Silk Touch, obviously. Only available at level 1.</li>
<li>Quickdraw: Draws back your bow instantly! Before getting your pitchforks out, do note that it cannot be applied with Infinity or Flame.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New items!

<ul>
<li>Dynamite: Simple throwable TNT! It is crafted out of a string on the top, a sand directly below that, and a piece of gunpowder below that or to the left. You can also dispense it out of a dispenser! Credits to TooMuchTNT, made by MinecraftTNTstuff, for the texture.</li>
<li>Fried Egg: Simply toss an egg in the furnace to produce it! It will heal 2.5 hunger bars.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Storage blocks for flint, sugar, and charcoal.

<ul>
<li>Sugar blocks fall just like sand.</li>
<li>Charcoal blocks can be used just like coal blocks in a furnace.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Falling blocks such as sand, sugar, and gravel can be fired out of dispensers. Great for suffocation traps!</li>
<li>Enhanced mob drops!

<ul>
<li>Named mobs will drop their name tags.</li>
<li>Bats drop leather and endermen drop their held blocks.</li>
<li>Creepers have a 1/10 chance of dropping a TNT block.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>More realistic predator/prey relationships! When ocelots kill chickens, the chickens won't drop meat! Same for wolves and sheep!</li>
<li>Players can throw ender pearls in creative mode, just like in Xbox!</li>
<li>Creepers and baby zombies burn in daylight. Wander far and near in comfort and safety!</li>
<li>Players can shear name tags right off mobs.</li>
<li>Seeds will plant themselves after a (randomly-determined) couple of seconds delay. Farms can now be more easily automated!</li>
<li>Enhanced mob spawners!

<ul>
<li>When hovering over mob spawners with your mouse in creative mode, you can see the name of the mob it spawns.</li>
<li>They drop themselves when you use silk touch.</li>
<li>They can be seen in the miscellaneous creative tab if you have NEI or TMI installed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Active potion effect icons are displayed in the top left corner!</li>
<li>Seeds/stems don't sound like stone anymore when you break them.</li>
<li>Fire no longer sounds like wool if you jump over it! (Seriously, why was that even there in the first place?)</li>
<li>Command blocks can be found in the redstone creative tab. Dragon eggs can be found in the decorations tab.</li>
<li>Buttons are named according to their material! (E.g. stone/wooden buttons)</li>
<li>Paper can be fished!</li>
<li>Stone tools are crafted out of stone rather than cobblestone.</li>
<li>You only need 3, rather than 6, source blocks to craft stairs. They are still crafted in the same pattern.</li>
<li>Crafting buttons gives you 4 rather than 1.</li>
<li>Potion and enchantment level roman numerals now are displayed up to level 128.</li>
<li>Tools can no longer be repaired by simply putting them together in a workbench. Use an anvil.</li>
<li>Lastly (finally), wool can be back-crafted into 4 string.</li>
</ul>

<p>Craft++ is extremely configurable. Everything from enabling and disabling enchantments to automatic seed planting can be configured straight from the config GUI, accessible from the mods menu or the game menu.</p>
