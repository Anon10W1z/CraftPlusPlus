<a id="welcome" class="anchor" href="#welcome" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome</h3>

<p>Welcome to Craft++'s website! This website contains the latest downloads, information, news and more for Craft++. Feel free to take a look around!</p>

<h3>
<a id="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h3>

<p>Craft++ is a mod designed to enhance vanilla Minecraft without going overboard. It is designed to be minimally invasive and configurable to create a user experience like none other.</p>

<h3>
<a id="features" class="anchor" href="#features" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h3>

<p>Craft++ adds a multitude of features to enhance your world. Warning for a wall of text:</p>

<ul>
<li>Storage blocks for flint, sugar, and charcoal. These act exactly like vanilla storage blocks. Sugar storage blocks have gravity, and charcoal blocks can be used like coal blocks in a furnace.</li>
<li>Falling blocks such as sand, sugar, and gravel can be fired out of dispensers. Great for suffocation traps!</li>
<li>Enhanced mob drops! Named mobs will drop their name tags. Bats drop leather and endermen drop their held blocks. Finally, creepers have a 1/10 chance of dropping a TNT block.</li>
<li>More realistic predator/prey relationships! When ocelots kill chickens, the chickens won't drop meat! Same for wolves and sheep!</li>
<li>Players can throw ender pearls in creative mode, just like in Xbox!</li>
<li>Creepers and baby zombies burn in daylight. Wander far and near in comfort and safety!</li>
<li>Players can shear name tags right off mobs.</li>
<li>Seeds will plant themselves after a (randomly-determined) couple of seconds delay. Farms can now be more easily automated!</li>
<li>When hovering over mob spawners with your mouse in creative mode, you can see the name of the mob it spawns.</li>
<li>Mob spawners drop themselves when using silk touch!</li>
<li>Active potion effect icons are displayed in the top left corner!</li>
<li>Seeds/stems don't sound like stone anymore when you break them.</li>
<li>Fire no longer sounds like wool if you jump over it! (Seriously, why was that even there in the first place?)</li>
<li>Command blocks can be found in the redstone creative tab.</li>
<li>Mob spawners can be found in the miscellaneous creative tab.</li>
<li>Buttons are named according to their material! (E.g. stone/wooden buttons)</li>
<li>Paper can be fished! I wonder what it says...</li>
<li>Stone tools are crafted out of stone rather than cobblestone.</li>
<li>You only need 3, rather than 6, source blocks to craft stairs. They are still crafted in the same pattern.</li>
<li>Crafting buttons gives you 4 rather than 1.</li>
<li>Lastly (finally), wool can be back-crafted into 4 string.</li>
</ul>
