{"name":"Craft++ Website","tagline":"The website for Craft++","body":"### Welcome\r\nWelcome to Craft++'s website! This website contains the latest downloads, information, news and more for Craft++. Feel free to take a look around!\r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\nCraft++ is a mod designed to enhance vanilla Minecraft without going overboard. It is designed to be minimally invasive and configurable to create a user experience like none other.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\nCraft++ adds a multitude of features to enhance your world. Warning for a wall of text:\r\n- Storage blocks for flint, sugar, and charcoal. These act exactly like vanilla storage blocks. Sugar storage blocks have gravity, and charcoal blocks can be used like coal blocks in a furnace.\r\n- Falling blocks such as sand, sugar, and gravel can be fired out of dispensers. Great for suffocation traps!\r\n- Enhanced mob drops! Named mobs will drop their name tags. Bats drop leather and endermen drop their held blocks. Finally, creepers have a 1/10 chance of dropping a TNT block.\r\n- More realistic predator/prey relationships! When ocelots kill chickens, the chickens won't drop meat! Same for wolves and sheep!\r\n- Players can throw ender pearls in creative mode, just like in Xbox!\r\n- Creepers and baby zombies burn in daylight. Wander far and near in comfort and safety!\r\n- Players can shear name tags right off mobs.\r\n- Seeds will plant themselves after a (randomly-determined) couple of seconds delay. Farms can now be more easily automated!\r\n- When hovering over mob spawners with your mouse in creative mode, you can see the name of the mob it spawns.\r\n- Mob spawners drop themselves when using silk touch!\r\n- Active potion effect icons are displayed in the top left corner!\r\n- Seeds/stems don't sound like stone anymore when you break them.\r\n- Fire no longer sounds like wool if you jump over it! (Seriously, why was that even there in the first place?)\r\n- Command blocks can be found in the redstone creative tab.\r\n- Mob spawners can be found in the miscellaneous creative tab.\r\n- Buttons are named according to their material! (E.g. stone/wooden buttons)\r\n- Paper can be fished! I wonder what it says...\r\n- Stone tools are crafted out of stone rather than cobblestone.\r\n- You only need 3, rather than 6, source blocks to craft stairs. They are still crafted in the same pattern.\r\n- Crafting buttons gives you 4 rather than 1.\r\n- Lastly (finally), wool can be back-crafted into 4 string.\r\n\r\n### Download\r\nThe newest versions of Craft++ are automatically built and compiled, courtesy of drone.io [here](https://drone.io/github.com/Anon10W1z/CraftPlusPlus/files).\r\nSource code can be found right here on [Github](https://github.com/Anon10W1z/CraftPlusPlus).\r\n\r\n### Miscellaneous\r\nI am the only coder of this mod.
