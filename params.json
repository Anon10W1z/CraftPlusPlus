Each level adds a bit to your movement speed and jump height, respectively.\r\n    - Veteran: Goes on your head, instantly increasing your knowledge! It will attract all experience orbs in a 32-block radius towards you!\r\n    - Blazing: Automatically smelts everything the block drops. If you have fortune on your item, it will increase the stack size of the drops accordingly - but not for drops that are blocks themselves. It cannot be applied with Silk Touch, obviously. Only available at level 1.\r\n    - Siphon: All mined block drops instantly go into your inventory! You won't have to deal with a pesky zombie or friend stealing your freshly-mined diamonds again! It is friendly with Silk Touch and Blazing.\r\n    - Quickdraw: Draws back your bow instantly! Before getting your pitchforks out, do note that it cannot be applied with Infinity or Flame. Like Blazing it is only available at level 1.\r\n    - Homing: Your arrows will aim right at your target. Level 1 works for entities 32 blocks away, level 2 works for entities 64 blocks away, and level 3 128 blocks away.\r\n- New items!\r\n    - Dynamite: Simple throwable TNT! It is crafted out of a string on the top, a sand directly below that, and a piece of gunpowder below that or to the left. You can also dispense it out of a dispenser! It won't work when wet, either by rain or water. Credits to TooMuchTNT, made by MinecraftTNTstuff, for the texture.\r\n    - Fried Egg: Simply toss an egg in the furnace to produce it! It will heal 2.5 hunger bars.\r\n    - Obsidian Boat: A boat for the nether: It works in lava, but not water. Be careful: it is hard to steer, and breaking it may lead to the loss of the boat if the item falls in lava. Craft it the same way you'd craft a boat, but with obsidian.\r\n- Storage blocks for flint, sugar, and charcoal.\r\n    - Sugar blocks fall just like sand.\r\n    - Charcoal blocks can be used just like coal blocks in a furnace.\r\n- Falling blocks such as sand, sugar, and gravel can be fired out of dispensers. Great for suffocation traps!\r\n- Enhanced mob drops!\r\n    - Named mobs will drop their name tags.\r\n    - Bats drop leather\r\n    - Endermen drop their held blocks.\r\n    - Creepers have a 1/10 chance of dropping a TNT block.\r\n- More realistic predator/prey relationships! When ocelots kill chickens, the chickens won't drop meat! Same for wolves and sheep!\r\n- Players can throw ender pearls in creative mode, just like in Xbox!\r\n- Creepers and baby zombies burn in daylight. Wander far and near in comfort and safety!\r\n- Players can shear name tags right off mobs.\r\n- Seeds will plant themselves after a (randomly-determined) couple of seconds delay. Farms can now be more easily automated!\r\n- Enhanced mob spawners!\r\n    - When hovering over mob spawners with your mouse in creative mode, you can see the name of the mob it spawns.\r\n    - They drop themselves when you use silk touch.\r\n    - They can be seen in the miscellaneous creative tab if you have NEI or TMI installed.\r\n- Active potion effect icons are displayed in the top left corner!\r\n- Seeds/stems don't sound like stone anymore when you break them.\r\n- Fire no longer sounds like wool if you jump over it! (Seriously, why was that even there in the first place?)\r\n- Command blocks can be found in the redstone creative tab. Dragon eggs can be found in the decorations tab.\r\n- Buttons are named according to their material! (E.g. stone/wooden buttons)\r\n- Paper can be fished!\r\n- Stone tools are crafted out of stone rather than cobblestone.\r\n- You only need 3, rather than 6, source blocks to craft stairs. They are still crafted in the same pattern.\r\n- Crafting buttons gives you 4 rather than 1.\r\n- Potion and enchantment level roman numerals now are displayed up to level 128.\r\n- Tools can no longer be repaired by simply putting them together in a workbench. Use an anvil.\r\n- Lastly, wool can be back-crafted into 4 string.\r\n\r\nCraft++ is extremely configurable. Everything from enabling and disabling enchantments to automatic seed planting can be configured straight from the config GUI, accessible from the mods menu or the game menu.\r\n\r\n### Downloads\r\nThe newest versions of Craft++ are automatically built and compiled, courtesy of drone.io [here](https://drone.io/github.com/Anon10W1z/CraftPlusPlus/files).\r\nSource code can be found right here on [Github](https://github.com/Anon10W1z/CraftPlusPlus).
